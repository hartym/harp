Applications
============

Overview
::::::::

Harp consists of a core library and a set of applications that provides features (including most of the core features).

To allow extensions to do basically anything, Harp uses the following components:

- a dependency injection container (provided by `rodi <https://www.neoteroi.dev/blacksheep/dependency-injection/>`_).
- an event dispatcher (provided by `whistle <https://python-whistle.github.io/>`_).
- an protocol to register applications as plug-and-play extensions to harp.

For now, look at the source of core applications.
